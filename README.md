# MOBILE ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM

### There are 2 things implemented in this project :
1. A website to show the impact of Mobile theft, Various mobiles and Data collected for mobiel theft.
2. Mobile Anti-Theft System Applications to detect the Mobile Theft in serval ways.

## ABSTRACT :

The project focuses on the domain of mobile device security, specifically addressing the issue of theft prevention and detection. Mobile theft is a significant concern globally, and this project aims to develop an effective anti-theft solution using Android Studio.

The primary aim of this project is to create a mobile application that can detect potential theft scenarios such as motion, charger disconnection, earphone removal, proximity changes, and SIM card changes. These detections will trigger alarms to notify users and deter theft. The project's repository will house the source code, documentation, and resources related to the development and implementation of the anti-theft application.

The development environment for this project is centered around Android Studio, a widely used integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. Android Studio provides a robust platform with essential tools for designing, coding, testing, and debugging Android applications. The project will leverage key features of Android Studio to implement various anti-theft detection modules efficiently. The development process will follow industry standards and best practices to ensure a reliable and user-friendly application.
